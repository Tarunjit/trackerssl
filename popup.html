  <div id="faq">
<p>While on the internet, you are being constantly tracked. Thousands of companies are using trackers to monitor your behavior and your preferences, mostly for advertising purposes. And they are not only monitoring you - they are most of the time doing that in insecure ways, exposing you even more.  </p>
<p>SSL is a protocol that allows secure communications over the internet. It establishes an encrypted connection between your computer and the webpage you are viewing. This is a good way to enhance your browsing privacy. You may check if you are on an encrypted connection to a website by looking for the expression "HTTPS://" at the beginning of the URL, or a closed lock icon in some browsers.</p>
<p>However, many sites do not implement secure connections. Also, some of those who implement secure connections do it in a way in which only part of the website is actually encrypted. Usually, all those trackers and third-party advertising tools fail in using SSL, which results in an even greater privacy threat.</p>
<p>We believe that more encryption and more information are the best ways to enhance everyone's privacy.  This is why we created TrackerSSL. This plugin collects information on all trackers which are present at a given website - and informs you on which of them use SSL encryption and which don't. It also allows you to share that information on Twitter, raising the global awareness about this problem.</p>
